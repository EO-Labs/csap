## Crypto Seed Accountancy Plateform


Attention unit: = time * focus

AU: U * 80% * 4h

focus = (charge) = I * t  
  
  
 U measured as social "reputation" and addressed resistance 
  
  
  
``` 
  W = P * t
  P = U * I
  U = R * I
  P = R * I^2 =  U^2/R

  @ = U * I * t
  W = U^2 * t / R
```

  would you send a few million to a wallet of a person you know (and trust)
  I predict big heist to come with "wallet interpersonation"
  (because public key are not as recognizable as our "public face" MiM)
 
  Why deFi ?
Does finance really need blockchain ?

finance need KYC to be trusted (can't have trustless commerce)
and if we have KYC why do we need decentralization ?
